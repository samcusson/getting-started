# Step 6 - Enhance It
Great stuff, we are up and running. Now why not try to make some changes to the microservice, test them locally, then push your update application to Predix. <br/><br/>

Here are a few ideas of things you might want to try to take your skills to the next level.<br/><br/>

### Predix
- Add another instance to your application (This is like adding a load balancer of clusering an application)
- View recent application logs (Check out the cheetsheet for example commands)
- Download, and push another groups microservice example (Eg pick the booking-microservice if you were working on a machine one)

### Javascript
- Use console.log statements to gain a better understanding of how the code works
- Try to add your own new  /api/v1/helloworld GET endpoint
- Add input validation to existing endpoints to make sure the inputs are being provided
- Modify the get bookings endpoint to return machine name instead of machine id (You will need to update the SQL query to include a join

### Testing
- We have included boilerplate testing examples. Try to get a simple test up and passing
